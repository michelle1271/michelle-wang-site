            <h3>travel ‚úàÔ∏è</h3>
            <p>My travel bucket list is defintely a long one, and I've been very lucky to have the opportunity to experience different cultures, architectures and nature. At the top of my list I want to visit the Dolomites in Italy! </p>

            <h3>hiking ‚õ∞</h3>
            <p>I love a good hike and taking in the nature around me! My favourite hikes have been in Utah and Arizona, and I definitely hope for more in my future. Hiking is also when my film camera gets the most use :D</p>

            <h3>crocheting üß∂</h3>
            <p>I recently starting crocheting and I'm hooked! (pun unintended) I can sit very still for hours working on plushies for my friends, from a Miffy keychain, to a smiski. I'm currently working on a Snoopy keychain for my backpack!</p>

            <p>Health is wealth! I grew up swimming competitively, and later coached for my club. This year as a New Year's Resolution I also began going to the gym, which I've really been enjoying! (special feature from my dog Bruno)</p>

            <h3>puzzles üß©</h3>
            <p>This pandemic hobby quickly became a favourite! I can sit for hours working on them without even noticing, and find that it's a great way to clear my mind. The one above is my 2nd 3000 piece (took lots of patience)!</p>

            <p>I always look forward to spending time with loved ones, whether that be playing a board game, going to the gym, a fun outing, or just talking. I'm so lucky to be surrounded by good people that I love spending time with :)</p>
